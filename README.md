# Extensions for Lore Archive
This repository is the home to **three** different aspects of the extensions made to the DokuWiki default engine and its plugins. The edits of the core files, the edits of the third-party plugins, and the plugins I have created.

## Core Edits
- **inc/parser/xhtml.php:** Wraps the heading inside a div, custom inline footnote generation
- **inc/html.php:** Custom TOC generation code
- **inc/template.php:** Modifies `tpl_searchform()` for custom search styling
- **lib/scripts/page.js:** Tippy.js support
